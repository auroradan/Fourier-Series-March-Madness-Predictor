# Fourier Series March Madness Predictor
## Goal and Specifications
We aim to predict the amount of wins each march madness team will have throughout the tournament. We will use the offensive and defensive efficiency ratings found at the attached hyperlink to create a function that gives an expected amount of wins for a team based on the ratings and performance of teams from previous years. 
## Technical Approach
To approach this problem, we are going to normalize data on offensive and defensive efficiency ratings for 64 teams by dividing the offense or defense rating of each team by the largest rating experienced in that year. We are also going to normalize the amount of wins a team gets by dividing by the maximum wins a team can get in a 64 team tournament (6 wins). By normalizing this data, we will ensure that all of the data for wins, and efficiency ratings will fall between 0 and 1. We will then use a two-dimensional discrete Fourier series, which will output a function that fits the data. This Fourier series could be used with the inputs offensive and defensive efficiency to predict the output of wins for each team in the tournament. We plan to use python and Jupyter Notebooks to compute the Fourier series and produce the fitted function. Finally, we will compare how well each team actually did with our prediction. 
## Challenges, Risks, and Fallback
Some challenges that we envision are learning the 2-dimensional Fourier series, getting the data from the website into a usable format, and developing that performs the Fourier series. To mitigate challenges with the 2-dimensional Fourier series, we will ask Professor Sidiropoulos and TAâ€™s who have used the 2-dimensional Fourier series before. A mitigation for obtaining data from the website is to manually create Excel spreadsheets of the data from each year. A fallback idea for a project would be to predict the final standing of a Premier League season using data on  net money spent by a club and average squad ages. This would utilize similar principles to our current idea, but would allow usage of more accessible data. This mitigates risk by making data easier to iterate through and providing a better output probability.

## Results
It is important to know that a greater offensive efficiency rating (points scored per 100 possessions) and a lower defensive efficiency (points allows per 100 possessions) is ideal.
